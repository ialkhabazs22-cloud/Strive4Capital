You are a senior full-stack engineer working in this repo. Make the following brand/content updates in a clean branch and open a PR.

Goals

Replace the brand blue #85abe4 everywhere with #2563eb (primary blue).

Update the homepage hero copy to the exact text below (no extra marketing fluff).

Replace every exact occurrence of “FundTek Capital Group” with “Lendura Capital.”

Branch & Setup

Create branch: feat/rebrand-blue-copy-rename

Do not touch node_modules, .git, lock files, or env files.

Run and build locally to confirm no type/style errors.

Color Changes

Replace all hex case variants of #85abe4 with #2563eb across these file types:
.css, .scss, .sass, .less, .pcss, .styl, .svg, .html, .mdx, .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx, .json, .yml, .yaml, .toml.

If Tailwind is used:

In tailwind.config.*, set theme.extend.colors.primary = '#2563eb' (create if missing).

If there is a custom brand color key (e.g., fundtek, brand, primary), point it to #2563eb.

Grep for any text-[#85abe4], bg-[#85abe4], border-[#85abe4] utility classes and update to #2563eb.

If CSS variables are used (e.g., --primary / --brand), update their values to #2563eb.

Update any inline styles or JSON theme tokens (e.g., theme.json, design-tokens.json) that contain 85abe4.

Hero Copy Update (exact text)
Find the current hero that reads roughly like:

“Flexible / Financing for / Every Industry”

“Empower your business with custom tailored financial and business solutions”

“Call us at (305) 307-4658 to see your options”

Replace the headline, subhead, and CTA with exactly:

Headline (H1): Flexible Financing. Real Solutions. For Every Industry.

Subhead (paragraph): Fuel your growth with funding tailored to your business—no cookie-cutter offers.

CTA/Contact line: Call (305) 307-4658 to see your best options today.

Notes:

Keep formatting clean (no emojis, no hype words, no “AI” tone).

Preserve existing classes/layout. Only swap the strings in the relevant hero component/template (likely index, Home, or Hero files).

If multiple hero variants exist, update the primary landing/home hero only.

Company Name Replacement

Replace exact string FundTek Capital Group → Lendura Capital across the repo (same file types as above).

Do not alter email addresses, domains, or legal entities unless the exact full string matches.

Update <title> tags, meta descriptions, footers, headers, nav, and PDF/OG meta if present.

Skip binary files.

Verification

Start dev server; verify:

No #85abe4 remains.

Primary interactive elements (buttons/links/CTAs) render in #2563eb.

Homepage hero shows the exact new copy.

“FundTek Capital Group” is fully replaced with “Lendura Capital” (search confirms 0 matches left).

Run linter/typecheck/build; fix any errors introduced by edits.

Deliverables

Commit with message: chore(brand): switch #85abe4 → #2563eb; update hero copy; rename brand to Lendura Capital

Open a PR titled: Rebrand: new blue, updated hero copy, FundTek → Lendura Capital

In the PR description, include:

A checklist of the three goals and their status (all checked).

A short note confirming Tailwind/CSS vars updated (if applicable).

A one-line grep proof that #85abe4 no longer appears.

Acceptance Criteria

Zero occurrences of #85abe4.

Hero text matches exactly the three lines provided.

Zero occurrences of the exact string FundTek Capital Group.

Build passes; site renders correctly.
