You are my senior full-stack engineer. Goal: refactor this repository into a Vercel-ready structure that deploys both the client (Vite front-end) and the backend (Express routes) as serverless functions.

Repository: Strive4Capital

Steps:

1. Project structure
- Ensure /client contains the Vite app. Move any static files from /attached_assets into /client/public.
- Create /api directory at repo root for backend functions.

2. Backend migration
- If /server contains an Express app, create /api/index.ts.
- Wrap the Express app with "serverless-http" so routes are exposed under /api/*.
- If only a few routes exist, create separate files in /api (e.g., /api/health.ts, /api/contact.ts).
- Install dependencies where needed: express, serverless-http, @types/express.

3. Config files
- At repo root, create package.json:
  {
    "name": "lendura-monorepo",
    "private": true,
    "scripts": {
      "build": "npm --prefix client ci && npm --prefix client run build",
      "dev": "npm --prefix client run dev"
    }
  }
- Ensure /client/package.json has dev, build, preview scripts with "vite build" outputting to /client/dist.
- Add vercel.json at root:
  {
    "framework": "vite",
    "buildCommand": "npm run build",
    "outputDirectory": "client/dist",
    "functions": {
      "api/**/*.ts": { "runtime": "nodejs20.x" },
      "api/**/*.js": { "runtime": "nodejs20.x" }
    },
    "rewrites": [
      { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "/api/$1" },
      { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
    ]
  }

4. TypeScript / functions
- Add a tsconfig.json inside /api with target: ES2020, module: commonjs if using TypeScript.
- Do not add extra build steps for functions; let Vercel compile them.

5. Clean up
- Remove Jotform embeds and make contact forms post to /api/contact.
- Update imports/links to assets in /client/public.
- Add /api/health endpoint returning { ok: true }.

6. Commit and push changes to GitHub.
